We are all looking for the next best book to read. As part of the Marketing Analytics Course, we attempted to build a recommendation engine in Python using data obtained from goodreads.

The first step was to perform an indepth exploratory analysis. We then went on to build a naive model based on KNN using cosine similarity and euclidean distance.
We also built a content based recommendation system using the tf-idf scores from the book description.
Our final model was a item and user based Collaborative Filtering model using Singular Value Decomposition.

All the analysis and model building was performed in Python
